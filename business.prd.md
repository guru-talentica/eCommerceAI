# Business Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## E-commerce Inventory Management Service

### Project Overview
This PRD defines the functional requirements for a simple e-commerce inventory management service that manages Categories, Products, and SKUs with full CRUD operations.

### Business Requirements Table

| Requirement | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **FR-001** | Create Category | As an Admin – I want to create new categories so that I can organize products into logical groups | System creates a new category with unique name and optional description. Returns success confirmation with category ID. Validates uniqueness and required fields. |
| **FR-002** | List All Categories | As an Admin – I want to view all categories so that I can see the current product organization structure | System returns paginated list of all categories with ID, name, description, and metadata. Supports consistent ordering and proper HTTP status codes. |
| **FR-003** | Get Category by ID | As an Admin – I want to view details of a specific category so that I can see its information | System returns complete category details including ID, name, description, creation date. Returns 404 for non-existent categories. |
| **FR-004** | Update Category | As an Admin – I want to update category information so that I can keep the product organization current | System updates category name and description while maintaining uniqueness constraints. Returns success confirmation and validates all changes. |
| **FR-005** | Delete Category | As an Admin – I want to delete categories so that I can remove obsolete product groupings | System deletes category only if no associated products exist. Prevents deletion with clear error message if products are linked. Returns appropriate status codes. |
| **FR-006** | Create Product | As an Admin – I want to create new products so that I can add items to the catalog | System creates product with name, description, and valid category assignment. Validates category existence and required fields. Returns success with product ID. |
| **FR-007** | List Products with Pagination | As an Admin – I want to view products with pagination so that I can review the catalog efficiently | System returns paginated product list with configurable page size and page number. Includes total count and pagination metadata. Supports default values. |
| **FR-008** | Get Product by ID | As an Admin – I want to view details of a specific product so that I can see its complete information | System returns complete product details including category information and associated SKUs. Returns 404 for non-existent products. |
| **FR-009** | Search Products by Name | As an Admin – I want to search products by name so that I can quickly find specific items | System performs case-insensitive partial/full name search with pagination support. Empty search returns all products. Combinable with filters. |
| **FR-010** | Filter Products by Category | As an Admin – I want to filter products by category so that I can view products in specific groups | System filters products by valid category ID while maintaining pagination. Validates category existence and supports combination with search. |
| **FR-011** | Update Product | As an Admin – I want to update product information so that I can keep the catalog current | System updates product name, description, and category with validation. Ensures new category exists and maintains data integrity. Returns success confirmation. |
| **FR-012** | Delete Product | As an Admin – I want to delete products so that I can remove obsolete items | System deletes product only if no associated SKUs exist. Prevents deletion with clear error if SKUs are linked. Returns appropriate status codes. |
| **FR-013** | Create SKU for Product | As an Admin – I want to add SKUs to products so that I can manage product variants | System creates SKU with unique identifier and attributes for valid product. Ensures global SKU code uniqueness and validates product existence. |
| **FR-014** | List SKUs for Product | As an Admin – I want to view all SKUs for a specific product so that I can review product variants | System returns all SKUs for specified product in consistent order. Shows complete SKU information and handles products with no SKUs gracefully. |
| **FR-015** | Get SKU by ID | As an Admin – I want to view details of a specific SKU so that I can see its complete information | System returns complete SKU details including associated product information and all attributes. Returns 404 for non-existent SKUs. |
| **FR-016** | Update SKU | As an Admin – I want to update SKU information so that I can maintain accurate variant details | System updates SKU attributes while maintaining code uniqueness constraints. Validates all changes and returns success confirmation. |
| **FR-017** | Delete SKU | As an Admin – I want to delete SKUs so that I can remove obsolete variants | System completely removes SKU without affecting associated product. Returns success confirmation and handles non-existent SKUs appropriately. |
| **FR-018** | Input Data Validation | As an Admin – I want the system to validate all input data so that data integrity is maintained | System validates required fields, data types, length limits, and formats. Returns descriptive error messages with field-specific validation failures. |
| **FR-019** | Relationship Validation | As an Admin – I want the system to enforce entity relationships so that data consistency is maintained | System enforces foreign key constraints preventing orphaned records. Validates relationships during create/update operations with clear error messages. |
| **FR-020** | Error Response Handling | As an Admin – I want to receive clear error messages so that I can understand and fix issues | System returns appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages. Logs system errors while protecting internal details from exposure. |
| **FR-021** | API Endpoint Standards | As an Admin – I want consistent API endpoints so that integration is predictable | System provides RESTful endpoints following standard conventions. Supports proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with consistent response formats. |
| **FR-022** | Pagination Support | As an Admin – I want pagination support so that I can handle large datasets efficiently | System implements page-based pagination with configurable page size. Returns metadata including total count, current page, and pagination links. |
| **FR-023** | Search and Filter Combination | As an Admin – I want to combine search and filter operations so that I can find specific data efficiently | System supports simultaneous name search and category filtering with maintained pagination. Ensures proper query parameter handling. |
| **FR-024** | Unique Constraint Enforcement | As an Admin – I want unique constraints enforced so that data duplicates are prevented | System enforces uniqueness for category names and SKU codes globally. Provides clear error messages when uniqueness violations occur. |
| **FR-025** | Cascade Deletion Prevention | As an Admin – I want cascade deletion prevention so that related data is protected | System prevents deletion of categories with products and products with SKUs. Returns clear error messages explaining relationship constraints. |

### Data Model Relationships
- **Category (1) → Product (Many)**: Each product belongs to one category
- **Product (1) → SKU (Many)**: Each SKU belongs to one product

- **Constraint**: Products cannot be deleted if they have associated SKUs
