Read this PRD Document and prepare a md file containing list of User stories and tasks

> Copilot: I'll help you read the PRD document and create a markdown file with user stories and tasks. Let me first examine the document in your workspace. I see that the document is a `.docx` file, which is a binary format that can't be read directly as text. Let me check if there are any other files in the workspace or if we need to convert this document first. Since the document is in `.docx` format (a binary format), I cannot directly read it with the available tools. To help you create a markdown file with user stories and tasks, I have a few options:
> 
> 1. **Convert the document to a readable format**: You could convert the `.docx` file to `.txt` or `.md` format using a tool like `pandoc` or by copying the content to a text file.
> 
> 2. **Copy and paste the content**: You could copy the content from the Word document and paste it into a new text file in the workspace.
> 
> 3. **Use an online converter**: Convert the document online and then add the text content to the workspace.

Act as a Senior Software Architect and ask me all the technical questions related to the PRD attached. DO NOT Implement unless explicitly ask you to.

> Copilot: As a Senior Software Architect, I have several critical technical questions about this PRD that need clarification before we proceed with implementation:
> 
> ## **Architecture & Technology Stack Questions**
> 
> 1. **Backend Technology Stack**: What technology stack do you prefer for this service? (Node.js/Express, Python/Django/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot, .NET Core, etc.)
> 
> 2. **Database Selection**: What type of database are you planning to use?
>    - Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)?
>    - NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)?
>    - What's your preference and reasoning?
> 
> 3. **API Architecture**: Are you planning a monolithic service or microservices architecture? Given the entities (Category, Product, SKU), should these be separate services or a single service?
> 
> ## **Data Model & Schema Questions**
> 
> 4. **SKU Attributes**: What specific attributes should SKUs have? The PRD mentions "attributes" but doesn't specify:
>    - Size, Color, Weight, Price?
>    - Are these dynamic attributes or fixed schema?
>    - Should we support custom attributes per product category?
> 
> 5. **Category Hierarchy**: Do you need hierarchical categories (parent-child relationships) or just flat categories?
> 
> 6. **Data Types & Constraints**:
>    - What's the maximum length for category names, product names, descriptions?
>    - Should we support rich text in descriptions or plain text?
>    - Any specific format requirements for SKU codes?
> 
> ## **Performance & Scalability Questions**
> 
> 7. **Expected Scale**: What's the anticipated data volume?
>    - Number of categories, products, SKUs?
>    - Expected concurrent users?
>    - Read vs Write ratio?
> 
> 8. **Pagination Strategy**: For the pagination requirement:
>    - What should be the default page size?
>    - Maximum page size allowed?
>    - Cursor-based or offset-based pagination preference?
> 
> ## **Search & Filtering Questions**
> 
> 9. **Search Requirements**: For product name search:
>    - Do you need full-text search capabilities?
>    - Should it search in descriptions too or just names?
>    - Any fuzzy search requirements (typo tolerance)?
> 
> 10. **Filtering Complexity**: Beyond category filtering:
>     - Do you need filtering by multiple categories?
>     - Price range filtering on SKUs?
>     - Date-based filtering (created/updated)?
> 
> ## **Security & Authentication Questions**
> 
> 11. **Authentication Strategy**: The PRD mentions "no auth" but for production:
>     - Will you implement authentication later?
>     - Should we design the API with future auth in mind?
>     - Any rate limiting requirements?
> 
> 12. **Data Validation**: What are the specific validation rules?
>     - Email format validation anywhere?
>     - Numeric constraints (min/max values)?
>     - Special character restrictions?
> 
> ## **API Design Questions**
> 
> 13. **Response Format**: What should be the standard API response format?
>     - Envelope format (data, status, message) or direct response?
>     - How should errors be structured?
>     - Timestamp formats (ISO 8601)?
> 
> 14. **Versioning Strategy**: How do you want to handle API versioning?
>     - URL versioning (/v1/api/products)?
>     - Header versioning?
>     - No versioning initially?
> 
> ## **Testing & Quality Questions**
> 
> 15. **Testing Strategy**: For the 90% coverage requirement:
>     - Unit tests only or integration tests included?
>     - Do you want contract testing for APIs?
>     - Performance testing requirements?
> 
> 16. **Code Quality Tools**: What tools should we integrate?
>     - Linting (ESLint, Pylint, SonarQube)?
>     - Code formatting (Prettier, Black)?
>     - Static analysis tools?
> 
> ## **Deployment & Environment Questions**
> 
> 17. **Deployment Target**: Where will this be deployed?
>     - Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
>     - Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)?
>     - Local development requirements?
> 
> 18. **Environment Configuration**: 
>     - How many environments (dev, staging, prod)?
>     - Configuration management strategy?
>     - Secret management requirements?
> 
> ## **Monitoring & Logging Questions**
> 
> 19. **Observability Requirements**:
>     - What metrics should we track?
>     - Logging format preferences (JSON, structured)?
>     - Error tracking integration (Sentry, etc.)?
> 
> 20. **Health Checks**: What health check endpoints do you need?
>     - Database connectivity checks?
>     - Dependency health checks?
> 
> ## **Business Logic Edge Cases**
> 
> 21. **Soft Deletes**: Should we implement soft deletes instead of hard deletes for audit trails?
> 
> 22. **Concurrent Updates**: How should we handle concurrent updates to the same entity?
>     - Optimistic locking?
>     - Last-write-wins?
> 
> 23. **Bulk Operations**: Do you need bulk operations for efficiency?
>     - Bulk create/update/delete products?
>     - Bulk SKU operations?
> 
> Please provide answers to these questions so I can design the most appropriate solution architecture for your specific needs and constraints.

> #### **3. Key Implementation Considerations**
> 
> **Elasticsearch Integration:**
> ```python
> # For advanced search with fuzzy matching
> from elasticsearch import AsyncElasticsearch
> 
> async def search_products(query: str, category_id: Optional[int] = None):
>     search_body = {

>             "bool": {
>                 "must": [
>                     {
>                         "multi_match": {
>                             "query": query,
>                             "fields": ["name^2", "description"],
>                             "fuzziness": "AUTO"
>                         }
>                     }

>             "fields": {
>                 "name": {},
>                 "description": {}
>             }
>         }
>     }
>     
>     if category_id:
>         search_body["query"]["bool"]["filter"].append(
>             {"term": {"category_id": category_id}}
>         )
> ```
> 
> **Optimistic Locking:**
> ```python
> async def update_product(product_id: int, update_data: ProductUpdate, current_version: int):
>     result = await database.execute(
>         "UPDATE products SET name = :name, version = version + 1, updated_at = NOW() "
>         "WHERE id = :id AND version = :version AND is_deleted = FALSE",
>         {
>             "name": update_data.name,
>             "id": product_id,
>             "version": current_version
>         }
>     )
>     
>     if result.rowcount == 0:
>         raise HTTPException(
>             status_code=409,
>             detail="Product was modified by another user. Please refresh and try again."
>         )
> ```
> 
> ### **⚠️ Critical Technical Decisions Needed**
> 
> 1. **SKU Attribute Schema**: Define the exact JSON structure for different product categories
> 2. **Search Index Strategy**: Decide on real-time vs batch Elasticsearch indexing
> 3. **Caching Strategy**: Define cache invalidation rules for product updates
> 4. **File Upload Limits**: Set max file sizes and allowed formats for images
> 
> ### **📋 Next Steps for Implementation**
> 
> 1. **Create detailed database schema** with indexes and constraints
> 2. **Set up FastAPI project structure** with async PostgreSQL connection
> 3. **Implement core CRUD operations** with proper validation
> 4. **Add comprehensive error handling** with your envelope format
> 5. **Integrate Elasticsearch** for search functionality
> 6. **Implement rate limiting and security middleware**
> 
> Would you like me to start implementing any specific component based on these recommendations? I can begin with the project setup, database schema, or any particular module you'd like to prioritize.

Act yourself as a Senior Python Developer. And start implementing the tasks in sequence.

> Copilot: As a Senior Python Developer, I'll start implementing the e-commerce inventory management service based on the technical requirements. Let me begin with the foundational tasks in sequence.
> 
> ## **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation**
> 
> Let me start with the core project structure and setup. 

Continue with #new workspace setup

> Copilot: I'll start by setting up a new workspace for the e-commerce inventory management service. Let me create the project structure and initialize it properly. Perfect! I have a new workspace set up. Let me start implementing the FastAPI e-commerce inventory management service step by step.
> 
> ## **Implementation Plan**
> 
> I'll create a FastAPI-based e-commerce inventory management service with:
> 1. FastAPI + PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy
> 2. Modular monolith architecture 
> 3. Hierarchical categories, products, and SKUs
> 4. Comprehensive testing and production-ready features
> 
> Let me start by getting the project template: I'll scaffold the project manually with the FastAPI structure. Let me start by creating the foundational project structure: Let me check for Python installation: Great! Now let me activate the virtual environment and create the project structure: Perfect! Now let me create the project structure and install dependencies: Now let me create the project directory structure: Now let me create the main application structure: Now let me install the dependencies: Great! All dependencies are installed. Now let me create the core application files: Now let me create the core configuration files: The imports are working, this is just VS Code not recognizing the virtual environment yet. Let me continue with the database configuration: Now let me create the Pydantic schemas: 

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

> Copilot: Now let's create the API endpoints structure and start with the category endpoints: Now let's create the services directory and implement the CategoryService: Now let's create the main FastAPI application and router setup: Now let's create a simple test to verify our setup and run the application: Let's create a simple test file and run the application to see if everything works: Now let's configure the Python environment and install dependencies so VS Code can recognize the imports: Now let's test if our application runs by starting it: Let's check if the server started successfully: We have a circular import issue with our schemas. Let's fix this by using forward references properly: Let me check the exact content of the category schema file: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let's fix the product schema file as well: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now we need to add forward reference imports and update the schemas to use proper imports. Let's fix this by setting up the schemas properly: 
> ```

> ```
> It looks like there was an issue with the replacement. Let me recreate the category schema file properly: Now let's update the product schema to use TYPE_CHECKING imports: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let's add model rebuilds at the end of the product schema: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let's update the SKU schema: 
> ```
> 
> ```
> 
> ```
> 
> ```
> Now let's try to start the server again: 

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

> Copilot: There's an issue with the schema __init__.py file. Let me check what's in it and fix it: The issue is that we're importing CategoryBase which might not be exported. Let me check what's actually in the category schema: The classes exist. Let me check the Python syntax by testing import directly: There's a circular import issue. Let me check the specific issue by looking at the exact imports: The issue is that when we import `app.schemas.category`, it first loads `app.schemas.__init__.py` which tries to import from category.py. Let me simplify the schemas __init__.py file to avoid this circular dependency: Now let's test the import again: Let me check what's actually wrong with the category.py file by examining its syntax: The syntax is fine. Let me check if there's a dependency issue by looking at the pydantic imports: Let me manually check the file by reading it and looking for issues: Let me try a different approach - let me check if there's an issue with the model_rebuild() calls at the end: The issue might be with the model_rebuild() calls. Let me remove them and try a different approach:

> Now let's test the import again: Let me examine this more carefully by checking if there are any invisible characters or encoding issues: Let me try a simpler approach - recreate the category schema file from scratch: Great! Now let's test the server: I need to update the imports in the categories endpoint file to match what's available:

> Now let's try starting the server again: Excellent! The server is now running successfully. Let's test the API by opening the interactive documentation: Perfect! The FastAPI server is running and the interactive documentation is accessible. Now let's test the API endpoints using curl to ensure they work: Now let's test creating a category: There's an issue with creating categories. Let me check what's wrong by looking at the error logs: There's a 500 error. The issue is likely that we haven't set up the database connection properly. We need to create the database tables first. Let me create a database initialization script: But first, let me check what database URL is being used by examining the config: The issue is that DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY are required but not set. Let me create a .env file with default values: The .env file exists but is set up for PostgreSQL. Since we want to test quickly, let me change it to SQLite:

> Now let's run the database initialization script: Great! The database tables have been created. Now let's test the category creation again: Let me check the detailed error in the server logs: The server reloaded but we're still getting 500 errors. Let me add better error logging to the CategoryService to see what's happening. The issue might be in the path generation or database constraints. Let me check what tables were actually created:
